## LPPAD Manager
### What is that ?
It is a PowerShell script solution made for SysAdmin \
who wants an easier way to use Lithnet Password Protection !
### What can I use it for ?
Most of the LPPAD commands are simplified to use them regularly. \
We have also added a log file wich contains all banned words that you will add.
### Why did you decide to log only banned words ?
It is just because we think that is the most important option in LPPAD, \
it also cans be inconvenient to remember all words you have added \
and moreover it's impossible to check the list of banned words.
### How can I make it works on my Domain Controller ?
You simply have to [install](https://github.com/U4I5/LPPADManager/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) our code, and then follow these steps :
* Lauch the script "LPPADManagerOpptions.ps1" for the first time. (Usefull for authorizations !)
* Launch also the main script "LPPADManager.ps1".
* Now you can use the first script !
